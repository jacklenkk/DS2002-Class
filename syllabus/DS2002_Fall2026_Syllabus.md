## Course Overview

By definition, "data science" must make meaning out of ever-growing pools of data. But the researcher quickly discovers that the hand examination of any data, while useful for granular analysis, is never adequate for large samples. To produce data science at scale, researchers must make effective use of workflows, pipelines, and processes to ingest, parse, and transform data with tools and automation.

This course centers on exposing students to contemporary pipelines for data analysis through a series of steadily escalating use cases. We begin with simple local database construction such as SQLite and evolve toward cloud-based systems such as AWS or Google Cloud. That progression includes data lakes and other non-SQL applications as appropriate. Along the way we learn systems for data collection, transformation, and consumption. We work with data wrangling, cleansing, ETL, APIs, and communication of results.

Everything is delivered in **notebooks** (Kaggle/Colab) so that running, grading, and submitting via Git is fast and consistent.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the semester, you will be able to:

1. Design and implement data pipelines that ingest, clean, and transform messy multi-source data.
2. Apply best practices in data wrangling, cleansing, and ETL using contemporary tools and automation.
3. Query and combine data using SQL (SQLite), Pandas, JSON, and public APIs.
4. Use version control with Git/GitHub and a notebook-first workflow to support collaborative, reproducible analysis.
5. Communicate findings with clear visualizations and plain-language recommendations.

## How the Week Works

| Day | What happens | Notebook | Time |
|-----|--------------|----------|------|
| **Monday** | Lecture: concept + live demo | `… — Lecture.ipynb` | ~45 min |
| **Wednesday** | Studio: guided build + breakout checkpoint | `… — Studio.ipynb` | ~45 min |
| **Friday** | Hands-on lab — your graded weekly work (async, do it on your own time) | `… — Lab.ipynb` | Async |

> **No separate homework.** Your Friday lab is the weekly graded assignment. Plan on it taking real time.

---

## Required Software

We are **100% in notebooks** — Kaggle or Google Colab. Nothing to install locally. All libraries we use (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sqlite3`, `requests`) are preinstalled on both platforms.

Two free accounts are required, and both take about two minutes:

- **GitHub** — <https://github.com>. Your work is versioned here, and the course notebooks live here. Needed before Lab 01.
- **Discord** — <https://discord.com>. Then accept the invite to the **DS2002F26** server: <https://discord.gg/zTr98dm6x>. This is how you get help during the week.

Set both up in the first week. If you already have accounts, use them — there is no need to make new ones for this course.

## Learning Resources

Readings are largely online articles linked in the weekly notebooks and Canvas. No textbook to purchase. From time to time, I will do readings for you in class — so pay attention to what we cover each week.

## Grading

### Grade Breakdown

| Component | Percentage | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **Weekly Labs** | **40%** | Released each Friday; you complete them on your own. About 13 over the semester. These are your main weekly practice — budget time accordingly. |
| **Midterm Project** (Walmart Hurricane Analytics) | **25%** | Group project (2–4), ~3 weeks. |
| **Capstone Project** (Game Day Pulse) | **30%** | Group project (3–4), ~4 weeks, includes a presentation. |
| **Class Participation** | **5%** | Studio breakout checkpoints submitted individually in Canvas. See below. |

### Class Participation (5%)

With ~53 students per section, participation is **not** graded on speaking in front of the room.

Each **Wednesday studio** ends with a short **breakout checkpoint**:
1. Work in **groups of 4–5** if you wish — grouping up is optional, and it does not have to wait for the end of class.
2. Complete the checkpoint cell at the bottom of that week's **Studio** notebook on your own.
3. Submit **individually** in Canvas (**Studio Checkpoint — Week X**) by **Thursday 11:59pm ET**.

**What to submit:** paste the printed output from the checkpoint cell, or upload a screenshot. One or two sentences is enough — e.g. what worked, what broke, or what your group tried.

**How it's graded:** mostly **completion**. Submit something plausibly tied to that day's studio and you get credit for that week. TAs spot-check; you are not graded on being loud or extroverted.

**Over the term:** **13** checkpoint opportunities. Submit **10** for full participation credit. Miss a few — no problem. Weeks with no studio meeting (e.g. Thanksgiving) do not count.

Collaborate in the room; **submit on your own.**

### Grading Scale

| Grade | Range |
|-------|-------|
| A | 93–100 |
| A− | 90–92 |
| B+ | 87–89 |
| B | 83–86 |
| B− | 80–82 |
| C+ | 77–79 |
| C | 73–76 |
| C− | 70–72 |
| D+ | 67–69 |
| D | 63–66 |
| D− | 60–62 |
| F | below 60 |

## Grading Policies

### Expectations

All labs and projects are due on time, by the due date/time indicated in Canvas. Submitting on time ensures you learn prerequisite skills and are prepared for the next set.

### Late Work — Two Automatic Extensions

You get **two automatic 7-day extensions** during the term, no questions asked, for **labs only** (not projects or participation checkpoints). Falling behind compounds — if you do fall behind, complete the earlier work first. All work must be completed by the end of the semester regardless of extensions; work submitted after the last day of the semester is not counted toward the final grade.

### Extenuating Circumstances

If you are struggling to catch up or extenuating circumstances arise, reach out early — the sooner you do, the more options we have. You may also contact your primary academic advisor or Advising Dean.

### Class Attendance

Come to class if you can. If you can't, let me know — I'm flexible and understand that life happens (sick days, interviews, etc.).

## Course Policies

### Communication and Response Time

Three channels, and it matters which one you use.

| What | Where | Why |
|------|-------|-----|
| Official notices — due dates, schedule changes, logistics | **Canvas Announcements** | This is the course record. You are responsible for reading it. |
| Course questions — "why does my push fail," "is my join wrong" | **Discord** | Fastest answer, and the next person with your problem can find it. |
| Anything personal — grades, accommodations, extensions, health | **Email** (<jasonw@virginia.edu>) | Private, and it creates a record we can both refer to. |

Ask course questions in Discord rather than by email. You will usually get an answer sooner, and the answer helps whoever hits the same wall next week. Anything with personal information in it belongs in email, not a public channel.

The sooner you tell me about something affecting your attendance or performance, the better our chance of solving it together.

### Discord — DS2002F26

Join here: <https://discord.gg/zTr98dm6x>. You need a free Discord account first (<https://discord.com>); if you already have one, use it.

**Set your server nickname to your real name and section** — for example `Jane Doe (001)`. With over a hundred students across two sections, a handle nobody can match to the roster means I cannot help you, credit you, or tell which section you are in.

Where to post:

- **Questions forum** — one thread per question. Search it before you post; there is a good chance your question is already answered.
- **Section channels** — logistics for your own section.
- **Not DMs.** Ask in the forum, not privately. It is not that I mind — it is that a DM answer helps exactly one person, and I would rather answer once where everyone can read it. Personal matters go to email.

**One firm rule about code.** The course policy below applies in Discord exactly as it does anywhere else: explaining an individual line, describing your approach, or debugging alongside someone is collaboration and is welcome. Posting a working solution to a lab — as text or a screenshot — is not, and it is an honor violation for both of you. Post the error, the line that confuses you, and what you already tried.

Discord is a convenience, not the record. If it disappeared tomorrow, everything you are graded on still lives in Canvas and GitHub.

### Academic Integrity: Collaboration and Cheating

Cheating tends to happen at higher rates in introductory programming-based courses when students get frustrated, feel there is only one "correct" way to write code, and because it is easy to copy and paste. The difference between collaboration and cheating comes down to intent: cheating circumvents the learning process; collaboration helps you and your classmates learn more deeply.

**Examples of cheating:**
- Copying someone else's text word-for-word, or copying text from an AI tool and passing it off as your own
- Sharing/showing code to circumvent learning (e.g., letting someone copy because of a deadline)
- Asking for help without trying first; asking someone to do the work for you
- Making your homework freely available on GitHub or elsewhere
- Sharing answers to quizzes

**Examples of what's okay:**
- Two people with the same code, as long as it wasn't copy-pasted from one another
- Sharing/showing individual lines of code to teach or explain
- Debugging together (only possible once both have written their own code)
- Sharing strategies, articles, blogs, and other resources

If you are stressed about the intensity of the course, message me and we will get you back on track.

### SDS Guidelines on AI Tools and Assistance

Generative AI tools (ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, Claude, image models, etc.) are **permitted at no penalty** for:
- Brainstorming and refining ideas
- Fine-tuning research questions
- Finding information on your topic
- Drafting an outline to organize your thoughts
- Checking grammar and style

**You are responsible for:**
- Acknowledging that LLMs produce incorrect facts and fake citations
- Acknowledging that code-generation models may produce inaccurate outputs
- Taking responsibility for any inaccurate, biased, or unethical content you submit, regardless of origin
- Properly citing the contribution of any AI tool in submitted material
- The entirety of anything you submit based on an AI query

**AI tools are NOT permitted for:**
- Impersonating students in classroom contexts (e.g., composing discussion posts or Zoom chat as if it were you)
- Completing group work assigned to you, unless the group agrees
- Writing a draft of a writing assignment
- Writing entire sentences, paragraphs, or papers to complete assignments

Improper or uncited use may result in a failing grade on the assignment and may be an honor violation depending on context. Used well and cited, foundation models can help you submit higher-quality work in less time — so their use is encouraged within these guidelines.
